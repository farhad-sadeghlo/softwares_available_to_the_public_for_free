I wanted to change the names of some folders and files on my system, I was like why not writing a software for it.

Maybe you need such a software too. So, here it is. Enjoy.

This software helps you change the names of folders or files placed in the current directory.
The first intention was to change dot, dash, and underline to blank spaces. If you need to change other characters you may let me know.

So filename(s) or foldername(s) as such would be changed accordingly.
